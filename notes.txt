STEP 4: Resume upload - in process - S3 still blocked, but unclear why

STEP 5: USAJOBS URL receiver - in process - currently set up for copy + paste job descriptions (we should probably develop some instructions around this). eventually switch to paste URL and fetch from USA JOBS api

STEP 6: Career coach - with loops.


Stuff about getting data:
const client = generateClient<Schema>({
  authMode: 'userPool',
}); #this auth mode thing is important

const [resumes, setResumes] = useState<Schema["Resume"]["type"][]>([]);

  const fetchResumes = async () => {
    const { data: items, errors } = await client.models.Resume.list();
    setResumes(items);
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchResumes();
  }, []);
