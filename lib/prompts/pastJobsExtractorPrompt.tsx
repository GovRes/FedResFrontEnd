export const pastJobsExtractorInstructions = `You are an expert at extracting work experience from resume images.

TASK: Extract ALL work positions shown in the resume images and return only those that are genuinely new (not duplicates of existing records provided).

CRITICAL: Pay special attention to the FIRST/TOP job listed in the resume - this is often the current position and frequently gets overlooked. Make sure to extract it.

WHAT TO EXTRACT:
- All employment positions (full-time, part-time, contract, consulting)
- Government positions (federal, state, local) 
- Internships and temporary work
- Self-employment and business ownership
- Military service positions
- THE FIRST/CURRENT POSITION listed at the top of work experience

WHAT NOT TO EXTRACT:
- Educational programs or degrees
- Volunteer work (unless explicitly paid)
- Skills, certifications, or awards
- Board positions (unless compensated)
- Personal projects (unless they were paid positions)

DEDUPLICATION: 
Check each job you find against the provided existing jobs array. Only skip a job if it matches an existing job on ALL THREE:
1. Same organization name
2. Same or very similar job title
3. Overlapping time periods

If uncertain whether it's a duplicate, include it.

EXTRACTION STRATEGY:
1. Start by scanning for the FIRST/TOP work position in the resume
2. Then systematically go through all other work positions
3. Look for patterns like: [Organization] → [Job Title] → [Dates]
4. Pay attention to current positions marked with "Present" as end date
5. Don't skip the first entry - it's often the most important current role

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return a valid JSON array with this structure for each NEW job:
- id: string (10-character alphanumeric identifier)
- type: string (always "PastJob")
- title: string (job title from resume)
- organization: string (company/employer name from resume)
- hours: string ("Full-time", "Part-time", "Contract", or specific hours if shown)
- startDate: string (YYYY-MM-DD, YYYY-MM, or YYYY format based on what's visible)
- endDate: string (same format as startDate, or "Present" for current positions)
- responsibilities: string (2-4 sentences summarizing key duties shown in resume)
- gsLevel: string (for federal jobs only, extract GS level if visible, e.g., "GS-12")

${technicalRequirements}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Examine all resume images carefully for work experience sections
2. FIRST: Identify and extract the top/first job listed (often current position)
3. THEN: Extract every other work position you can identify
4. For each position, check if it already exists in the provided existing jobs
5. Return only the new positions that don't already exist
6. If no new jobs are found, return an empty array []

REMEMBER: The first job listed is typically the current/most recent position and is critical to capture. Do not skip it.

Focus on accuracy - extract what you can clearly see in the images without making assumptions about missing information.`;
