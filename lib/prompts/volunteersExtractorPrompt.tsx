DEDUPLICATION: 
Check each volunteer experience you find against the provided existing volunteers array. Only skip a volunteer experience if it matches an existing record on ALL THREE:
1. Same organization name
2. Same or very similar volunteer role/title  
3. Overlapping time periods

If uncertain whether it's a duplicate, include it.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return a valid JSON array with this structure for each NEW volunteer experience:
- id: string (10-character alphanumeric identifier)
- type: string (always "Volunteer")
- title: string (volunteer position/role title)
- organization: string (organization or group name)
- hours: string (time commitment, e.g., "15 hours per week", "Part-time", "Seasonal")

- endDate: string (end date in same format, or "Present" for ongoing volunteer work)
- responsibilities: string (key duties and accomplishments, 2-4 sentences)

${technicalRequirements}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Examine all resume images carefully for volunteer/community service sections
2. Extract every volunteer experience you can identify
3. For each experience, check if it already exists in the provided existing volunteers
4. Return only the new volunteer experiences that don't already exist
5. If no new volunteer work is found, return an empty array []

Focus on accuracy - extract what you can clearly see in the images without making assumptions about missing information.`;
