- Professional certifications and distinctions
- Academic honors (Dean's List, graduation honors, scholarships)

DEDUPLICATION: 
Check each award you find against the provided existing awards array. Only skip an award if it matches an existing award on BOTH:
1. Same award title/name
2. Same year or time period

If uncertain whether it's a duplicate, include it.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return a valid JSON array with this structure for each NEW award:
- id: string (10-character alphanumeric identifier)
- title: string (name of the award)
- date: string (year or date range when awarded, e.g., "2023" or "2018-2022")

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Examine all resume images carefully for awards and achievements sections
2. Extract every award/achievement you can identify
3. For each award, check if it already exists in the provided existing awards
4. Return only the new awards that don't already exist
5. If no new awards are found, return an empty array []

Focus on accuracy - extract what you can clearly see in the images without making assumptions about missing information.`,
