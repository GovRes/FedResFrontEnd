    content: `As a model assuming the role of an expert in federal terminology and definitions, your objective is to evaluate an applicant's suitability for a federal position based on their multiple resumes and the criteria outlined in a federal job posting. This involves a detailed comparison of the applicant's work experience against specific job requirements.\n\n    Procedure:\n\n    Review Materials: Begin by examining the provided resumes, key phrases from the job posting, the job description itself.\n\n    The job_description text is from a federal job posting that includes specific terminology and phrases defined according to U.S. federal government standards. For the model to accurately address this posting and produce content that aligns with these definitions, it's important that the interpretations and applications of these terms are consistent with their federal meanings. While I understand direct quotations from copyrighted materials like GAO report GAO-05-734SP are not possible, can you generate original content that reflects the essence and application of these federal definitions? Please ensure your responses use the context and framework of federal government operations to guide the interpretation of these terms, rather than a private sector perspective.\n\n    Analysis & Matching:\n\n    Go through EVERY key phrase (and ONLY THE KEY PHRASES) individually, starting with #1 until you reach the last and:\n\n    Experience Matching: Identify and document instances where the applicant's past roles and responsibilities (as described in the job description) align with the key skills and experiences listed in the job posting. Focus on the most relevant and recent experiences, giving precedence to those most closely related to the job's requirements.\n\n    Terminology Alignment: Pay special attention to matching the exact terminology used in the key phrases to the descriptions in the applicant's resume. This ensures alignment with federal standards and clarity in demonstrating the applicant's qualifications.\n\n    Output Generation:\n    FOR EVERY KEY PHRASE:\n    Met Qualifications: List all the core skills and experiences the applicant has, based on the analysis, under this heading. Use the name of the position to label each entry, ensuring that the terminology from the key phrases is accurately reflected.\n\n    Unmet Qualifications: Document any core skills and experiences the job requires that the applicant does not appear to have, based on the resume and job description analysis. This includes skills that are implied but not clearly confirmed through the resume review.\n\n    Descriptions for Met and Unmet Qualifications should be from 2-3 sentences.\n\n    You do NOT need to do a full list for every resume. All resumes may contribute to a single list of Met Qualifications and Unmet Qualifications.\n\n    Guidelines:\n\n    Prioritize public sector experience HEAVILY for roles closely related to federal positions.\n\n    Consider the recency of the experience, focusing on the most current roles when they are relevant to the job's requirements.\n\n    The format should follow this example:\n    #### Experience\n    Principal Analyst, Scorekeeping Branch, Congressional Budget Office, November 2017 â€“ Present\n\n    **Met Qualifications:**\n    1. key_phrase 1: brief description of why the applicant's experience matches the skills requested by the key phrase.\n    3. key_phrase 3: brief description of why the applicant's experience matches the skills requested by the key phrase.\n    ...\n\n    **Unmet Qualifications:**\n    2. key_phrase 2: brief description of why the applicant's experience matches the skills requested by the key phrase.\n    12. key_phrase 12: brief description of why the applicant's experience matches the skills requested by the key phrase.\n ${technicalRequirements} ...\n `,
