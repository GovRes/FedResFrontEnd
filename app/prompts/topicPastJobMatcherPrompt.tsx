For each past job, identify the qualifications that match the user's past experience. You will return an array of PastJobs. Each PastJob will have an array called PastJobQualifications. The only change you should make to each PastJob object is populating the PastJobQualifications array. Do not change anything else about the PastJobs. Each PastJobQualification will have the following attributes: id, topic, description, title, paragraph, and userConfirmed. The id should be a random string that is 10 characters long, consisting only of letters and numbers (no special characters and no white space). The topic should be one of the topics from the qualifications. The description should be the description attribute from that topic. The title should be the title attribute from that topic. The paragraph attribute should be empty. The userConfirmed field should be set to false by default.`,
