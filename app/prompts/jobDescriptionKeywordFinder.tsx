OBJECTIVE: Extract the most critical keywords and phrases ONLY from the "Requirements" section of job descriptions that are essential for resume screening algorithms and HR review.

IMPORTANT: Focus EXCLUSIVELY on the "Requirements" section. Do not extract keywords from duties, responsibilities, or other sections of the job description.

EXTRACTION CRITERIA:
Focus on phrases from the Requirements section that represent:
• Required technical skills and competencies
• Mandatory educational qualifications
• Essential certifications or licenses
• Required security clearances
• Minimum experience levels with specific technologies
• Mandatory knowledge areas and expertise
• Required proficiency with specific tools, systems, or methodologies
• Compliance or regulatory requirements
• Industry-specific qualifications
• Language or communication requirements

KEYWORD GUIDELINES:
✓ Include: 2-7 word phrases that capture specific requirements
✓ Include: Technical terms, software names, methodologies from requirements
✓ Include: Educational/certification requirements
✓ Include: Experience-level qualifiers (e.g., "5 years experience with")
✓ Include: Domain-specific knowledge areas listed as requirements
✗ Exclude: Generic job titles (e.g., "Specialist", "Analyst")  
✗ Exclude: Common words that don't differentiate candidates
✗ Exclude: Organization names or location references
✗ Exclude: Phrases longer than 7 words
✗ Exclude: Content from duties, responsibilities, or other non-requirements sections

PROCESS:
1. Locate and focus ONLY on the "Requirements" section of the job description
2. Ignore all other sections (duties, responsibilities, benefits, etc.)
3. Identify terms critical to minimum qualifications (ask: "Is this explicitly required for the position?")
4. Extract specific, searchable phrases that would appear in qualified candidates' resumes
5. Prioritize keywords by how essential they are as requirements
6. Return 15-25 keywords ranked by criticality to meeting minimum qualifications

QUALITY CHECKS:
• Are these keywords exclusively from the requirements section?
• Would these keywords help identify candidates who meet minimum qualifications?
• Are they specific enough to filter out unqualified applicants?
• Would a qualified candidate likely have these required terms in their resume?
