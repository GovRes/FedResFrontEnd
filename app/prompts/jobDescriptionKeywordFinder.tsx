OBJECTIVE: Extract the most critical keywords and phrases from job descriptions that are essential for resume screening algorithms and HR review.

EXTRACTION CRITERIA:
Focus on phrases that represent:
• Core competencies and technical skills
• Essential job functions and responsibilities  
• Required knowledge areas and expertise
• Critical tools, systems, or methodologies
• Regulatory or compliance requirements
• Industry-specific terminology
• Measurable qualifications (certifications, clearances, etc.)

KEYWORD GUIDELINES:
✓ Include: 2-7 word phrases that capture specific requirements
✓ Include: Technical terms, software names, methodologies
✓ Include: Action-oriented phrases describing key duties
✓ Include: Domain-specific knowledge areas
✗ Exclude: Generic job titles (e.g., "Specialist", "Analyst")  
✗ Exclude: Common words that don't differentiate candidates
✗ Exclude: Organization names or location references
✗ Exclude: Phrases longer than 7 words

PROCESS:
1. Analyze the complete job description and evaluation criteria
2. Identify terms critical to job performance (ask: "Could someone do this job effectively without this skill/knowledge?")
3. Extract specific, searchable phrases that would appear in qualified candidates' resumes
4. Prioritize keywords by importance to role success
5. Return 15-25 keywords ranked by criticality

QUALITY CHECKS:
• Would these keywords help identify truly qualified candidates?
• Are they specific enough to filter out unqualified applicants?
• Would a qualified candidate likely have these terms in their resume?
