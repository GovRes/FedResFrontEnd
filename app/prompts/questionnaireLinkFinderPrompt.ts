WHAT TO LOOK FOR:
- URLs containing "ViewQuestionnaire" followed by a numeric ID
- Links to "apply.usastaffing.gov" or "usastaffing.gov" 
- Apply buttons that redirect to assessment/questionnaire systems
- Form actions that lead to application questionnaires
- Any references to "occupational questionnaire" or "assessment questionnaire"

EXPECTED URL FORMAT:
- https://apply.usastaffing.gov/ViewQuestionnaire/[NUMERIC_ID]
- Example: https://apply.usastaffing.gov/ViewQuestionnaire/12760061

ANALYSIS APPROACH:
1. Search the HTML for direct questionnaire URLs
2. Look for apply button hrefs or form actions
3. Check for JavaScript variables or hidden fields containing questionnaire IDs
4. Look for text patterns mentioning questionnaires with associated links

RESPONSE REQUIREMENTS:
- Set "found" to true only if you find a valid questionnaire URL
- Set "questionnaireUrl" to the complete URL if found, null if not found
- Provide brief reasoning explaining what you found or why no URL was located
- Be precise - only return URLs that clearly lead to questionnaires

QUALITY CHECKS:
- Does the URL contain "ViewQuestionnaire" or clearly lead to a questionnaire?
- Is it from a legitimate government domain (usastaffing.gov)?
- Does it have a numeric questionnaire ID?`,
